<div align="center"><strong>Forked from the incredible work of the Apollo & Graphcool teams (https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql).</strong></div>
<div align="center">Taking one of the oldest CMS and combining it with cutting-edge API technology :) For those who want to bootstrap headless WordPress (i.e. using WP as a backend only) with user authentication integrated into a frontend (built with React). I've made some slight changes to this boilerplate to allow you to immediately convert your monolithic WordPress community into a scalable user platform in minutes (without rehiring a new dev team)!</div>

<br />

## Requirements
-- Must have an existing WordPress site with WP-GraphQL (https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) and WP-GraphQL-JWT-Auth (https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication) plugins installed and activated.

As you may have guessed, this boilerplate uses JSON web tokens for auth.

## Quickstart

1. CD into folder
2. yarn install && yarn start

**Work in progress.. Next up is integrating feeds from the WordPress API.
